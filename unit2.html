    The website will work as both a portfolio for my in-progress python works outside of the course, as well as a receptacle for these questions I have been assigned. The website will consist of an about me intro page, and two other pages for each of the unit.. As my knowledge of CSS will be gained during the work, the specifics of formatting will be developed and decided upon as I continue to fill in the page.

    Copyright laws differ slightly all over the world, so there are steps you should do to keep your work protected and be sure you are honoring the copyrights of others. The code of the page should have a notice somewhere inside declaring your copyright over the material, in visible text. Or a link to your notice visible somewhere on the page.. Your images need the copyright symbol pasted in a corner. And any file downloaded or sent from your website should have it in invisible text. When creating a webpage for a third party, make sure all copyrights are transferred ownership correctly, as well being sure to register your website’s copyright online. If you are interested, tools can also be used to hunt for infringements of your site’s copyright, where you can then decide to move on with takedown notices to enforce your hold of the intellectual property.

    A multitude of disabilities and special cases should be considered when making a website. There are those that need to use the page with limited mobility in their hands or must use the interface in a more abstract manner. So making sure the content is easily navigated and links are easily accessed can make it easy for people to get through your page with as little input as possible. Sight is a major thing to keep in mind as well, as those with certain colour blindnesses will need the page formatted in such a way so that colours that fade together in their eyes don’t make the page indecipherable. Or have a colour-blind mode that is easily switched to. Also keeping text as plain text instead of imbedded into an image can keep the page readable by a screen-reader for those that are completely blind.
