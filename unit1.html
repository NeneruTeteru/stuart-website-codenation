    <h4>1.1</h4>
    <p class="questions">
    Business today relies almost entirely on IT systems to run. The data a business uses to run is probably stored on a computer system, with backups stored over internet connections elsewhere and on backup hard-drives. If the business has a website, it was be hosted on a server and managed by an IT team. The way the business communicates with customers and other businesses will probably be over the internet. IT systems are the central nervous system of modern businesses and are required for the smooth operation of every section of a business.

    <p class="questions">
    Any project, regardless of the content and scope, requires proper planning first and foremost. Tools like Trello can be used to properly and efficiently keep things in order. If you are doing programming, languages like Python, C++ and all its iterations, HTML, Javascript, Ruby, etc… can be used, all suited for different platforms for the finished projects. If doing penetration testing, tools that exist on a platform like Kali Linux are used to help test the security of a system. And the most important skill, beyond just knowing how to use the tools, is knowing how to transfer knowledge of one program to another, and research how to do what you know is possible in one language to another.

    <p class="questions">
    To make this website, first thing is to decide the content. Like these questions that I’m answering at the minute. Next, would be to create a Trello to plan and carry out tasks and keep myself organised in terms of the scope and progression of the site. https://trello.com/b/V0Lygyvg/coding-website-stuart From there, I will research and implement HTML procedures in order to create tables and format the website for insertion of the information I am collating now.

    <p class="questions">
    Digital projects have a unique fault that non-internet based ones don’t, and that is corruption or loss of data from things like power failure of malicious cyber attacks. Keeping backups regularly and making sure to save at regular intervals will keep any loss from being catastrophic. Proper planning is as useful and necessary in IT projects as they are for offline projects as well. Failure can come from a lack of foresight into what is achievable and working to those goals, or the hand of god smacking down your connection or power supply and losing you all that you’ve done. So just plan properly and be prepared so it won’t happen.

    <h4>1.5</h4>
    <p class="questions">
    In order to pick the right tool for the job, first you need to know the scale and scope of the project. Are you programming? What is the end-goal for your program? Will it be web-hosted? Back end? Mobile Application? Javascript, HTML, Python and Swift are all used in these, but which is best depends on what you are trying to make with it. Having knowledge of one system is essential, though, and having the knowledge to transfer your knowledge and research how to use that in a different language is most critical.

    <p class="questions">
    Python has helped in the conveniences it’s added to modern versions, highlighting errors in my code and colour coding the rest for ease of understanding. Trello keeps me organised and on task, as well as help give a visual representation of what I still need to do. And GitHub is a useful way of collating all the code written so far together in one easily logged and managed area for use by all people within a team.

    <p class="questions">
    When working to ensure your projects are GDPR compliant, be sure to consider what information you are gathering with this project and how you store it. Keep backups regular and secure, and be sure that your systems are not publically open or have allowed access to more people than is strictly necessary in order to run. The most vulnerable part of any IT system is always the people, so be sure all involved are properly trained in current legal practices for IT and follow them correctly.

<h2> Outcome 2 Questions</h2>
<br>

<H4> 2.1</H4>

<p class="questions">
In today’s market of programming applications, we have come a long way. No longer are the plain text files that must be painstakingly made just right and read through carefully. Things like VSCode and Python’s IDLE allow for a more convenient method of coding a program. Color coding, auto-indenting and even built-in debuggers allow for a greater ease of use when it comes to designing and troubleshooting the code. Services like Trello are a new one for me, and help immensely at keeping myself organised when working with a group. Honestly, in a solo setting it feels like just an extra thing I have to go through and make sure is done properly rather than actually helping me. But others, or even in group settings, it is a great tool to make sure everyone knows what needs doing still and organising the project in a clear manner.
</p>
<br>
<h4>2.2</h4>

<p class="questions">
The tools used in this project have evolved and adapted from the last I looked at them, that I can’t imagine what would be a more suitable tool for what we’ve used. As I said, I feel Trello isn’t as useful for everyone in solo-projects. Such as this website, but beyond that it is a fantastic project organiser. Python IDLE is a great first IDE, not too many bells and whistles to get distracted with but for people that get more confidence and experience and want more advanced programs for the capability to more easily make large projects, things like PyCharm work wonders. Allowing for multiple languages and projects to be seamlessly stitched together.
</p>
<br>
<h4>2.3</h4>

<p class="questions">
As a final project, I am happy with the website only in terms of demonstrating a basic knowledge of the systems of HTML and CSS, though am heavily frustrated by my lack of creative flair. I tend to like very simplistic designs, and create the same. But I do wish I had more creativity and talent to design and put together larger projects. In the future, if I were to edit this site more, I’d hire an actual graphic designer to help come up with the layout of each page, allowing me to focus more on technical aspects while someone else makes the pretty happen. Also, many of these answers could do with longer and much more in-depth responses, the kind afforded to someone with a wealth more knowledge and more time with which to conduct and present that research. In the end, I’m happy with it as an assignment, clearly showing my understanding of the different principles we have learned about HTML and CSS so far, but unhappy with it as a finished project open to the public. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>2.4</h4>

<p class="questions">
As mentioned in the previous question, a professional designer would be brought in to help come up with the actual design, as that’s one of those weak spots that pervades all areas of my life. I would also go more in-depth with the actual HTML of the website, showing off more technical ability, given the time and some more research. Drop-down menus would be used for the links. And there would be bordering and columns made for each question. Something to make the page seem just a little less like a nicely formatted .doc file.
</p>
<br>
<H2>Outcome 3 Questions</H2>
<br>
<h2>3.1</h2>
<br>
<p class="questions">
    The website could have been made much more efficient through a variety of means. A full knowledge of how the tools connected together from the start would have meant the HTML could have been written originally in a manner that allowed for easier editing and less going back into the HTML to add classes and IDs in order to format the way envisioned in the design outline of the website. The tools formatting and colour coding is fantastic, but the auto-complete function can be an absolutely pain in the rear to deal with in the case of going back to add formatting after-the-fact. This is heavily outweighed by the positives, however.
</p>
<br>
<h4>3.2-3.3</h4>
<p class="questions">
    In the future, designing the page briefly as a draft, without code first, can help create a vision for the final project. As well as consulting someone with actual design knowledge and experience, with more creative flair for coming up with aesthetically pleasing webpages. As well as that, having a dedicated workspace with a music setup is a must for me. As with my attention deficit disorder, keeping on task can be a real problem when others are about and I need a tool to keep me focused. Working with a team on different elements can greatly improve productivity. If instead of having to keep switching between each thing as and when needed, if a team was split up into dedicated positions, it allows a member to specialise and truly focus on the design and execution of a particular area of the coding and less likely to forget something in the constant switching between tasks.
</p>
<br>
<h4>3.4</h4>

<p class="questions">
    Now that the page is done, I will be testing it and outlining ways more advanced tests can be done in the future. First and foremost, is the viewing of each page as a finished project within different browsers. Making sure each page looks properly, and all clickable elements work while taking you to their correct page. More advanced IDE platforms like PyCharm include built-in debuggers, that can take you to and point out problems with the way you’ve coded a page before you even try it for the first time. But as well as that, bringing the page to a new user that doesn’t know the code is useful, as it allows you to see if all tasks can be achieved easily by someone seeing it all for the first time. Or if you need to do more work to tighten up the code and also present everything in a more easily digestible manner.
