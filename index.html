    <div>
    <p class="questions">I am a junior IT professional who has experience working as a network administrator for small businesses and more recently have completed training in cyber security and begun to learn programming languages like Python. IT has always been my passion, even through years of customer service my spare time has been spent learning more about computer systems and how to maintain them, as well as gaining experience with different UIs and programs. My decision to come to CodeNation was influenced by a desire to secure a career more heavily focused on programming and so far it has been a great jumping off point to learn more programming myself.</p>
